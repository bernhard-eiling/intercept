Intercept is a game prototype for Android using the AndEngine for 2D openGL graphics. http://www.andengine.org/

The goal ist to defend your mothership in space by drawing courses for your interceptors to shoot incoming attackers and avoid asteroids.

A running prototype is installed on my private Android device.
